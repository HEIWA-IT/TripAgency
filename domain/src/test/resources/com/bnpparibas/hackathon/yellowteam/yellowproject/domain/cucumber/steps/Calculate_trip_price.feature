Feature: as a travel agency, I want to calculate travel fees depending on the departure and destination trip.
  To facilitate the use case, we will use always the same departure Lille.
  We will only need the destination.
  The trip pricer computes the total price of the trip using the ticket price, the stay fees (hotel, activities, ...)
  and the agency fees added together.

  The ticket price defined is always based on the economic one.
  Depending of the class chosen by the customer, the travel class value multiplier factor will change:
  - for the economic one class value is 1
  - for the first one, class value is 2
  - for the business one, class value is 5

  If the destination wanted is not know by the pricer, it returns a missing destination message

  Rule 1: Trip_price = (ticket_price * travel_class) + stay_fees + agency_fees
  Rule 2: If the destination wanted by the customer is not in the system, the pricer returns a missing destination message.

  Scenario Outline: Determine the fees for a supported destination
    Given the customer wants to travel to <destination>
    And the economic travel ticket price is <ticketPrice>€
    And the customer wants to travel in <travelClass> class
    And the stay fees are <stayFees>€
    And the agency fees are <agencyFees>€
    When the customer asked for the trip price
    Then the trip price is <tripPrice>€

      | "Lille"     | "ECONOMIC"  | 0           | 0        | 0          | 0         |
